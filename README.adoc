= Stackable Spark Operator

This is an operator for Kubernetes that can manage https://spark.apache.org/[Apache Spark] clusters.

WARNING: This operator does _not_ work with containers/container images. It relies on the https://github.com/stackabletech/agent/[Stackable Agent] to run on "bare metal" via systemd

== Building

This operator is written in Rust.
It is developed against the latest Rust release (1.50.0-nightly at the time of writing this).

NOTE: This requires Rust nightly due to the use of the `backtrace` feature.

    cargo build

== Configuration Options

The cluster can be configured via a yaml file.
Each node type (Master, Worker, History-Server) can have multiple instances within multiple selectors.
Multiple instances in the same selector can lead to port duplicates which results in the affected node
to increase the port one by one. Keep that in mind when e.g. running multiple masters without specified ports
on the same node.

=== Structure

There are three levels of configuration:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Common shared options
|Contains configuration that is shared within the whole cluster. E.g. the spark image, secrets, encryption or logging options.

|Node type options
|This configuration is shared for all nodes of a certain type (Master, Worker, History-Server)

|Selector specific options
|Options provided in the selector are limited to one certain node of a node type (Master, Worker, History-Server) and apply to one physical machine.
